<h1>Our cats</h1>
<h2>Fenty</h2>
<p>Lady Fenty is our playful Siamese mix. If she's not fast asleep, hiding away in some drawer, laundry basket or cupboard, you'll find her up on the highest trees of the neighborhood, on second floor window-sills or on our next-door supermarket's roof.</p>

<h2>Pati</h2>
<p>Our Mr. Grumpy Cat, supposedly a Persian mix or even a York Chocolate, if we insist on specifying his highness' race. Pati came to us as a 9 months-old adolescent and has never been the cuddly type. We love him dearly nevertheless.</p>
