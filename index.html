    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Summary</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">As a passionate learner and tech-savvy career changer out of conviction, I
        consciously choose leaving my comfort zone. In doing so, I draw on my
        wide-ranging experience, always expanding and combining it with new skills and
        know-how and applying it in a result-oriented way. Thus I am a very versatile
        teamplayer. Due to my extroverted, communicative nature, gaining access to
        new colleagues and teams comes easy to me. "We've always done it that way"
        triggers me, because I like to question existing processes, always on the lookout
        for optimization potential or a smoother workflow. Without having the sometimes
        limited view of a subject matter expert, I bring fresh perspectives into the game
        and challenge others to think outside the box.</p>
