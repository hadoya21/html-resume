<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<h2>(I call them the 3 C's - cats, coffee, culture - and friends)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cats</h3>
<p>If you're also a cat-person like me, feel free to roam through some more pictures of Fenty (left) and Pati (right) by clicking on the photo below. And if not - well, just acknowledge that you're looking at two very cute felines who both share my love for stiff froth on a tasty Latte Macchiato.</p>

<h3>Coffee</h3>
<p>Don't get me started... On my Facebook account, I administer a photo album filled with over 4500 pictures of all the good-looking kinds of coffee I have consumed over the past years. About 2/3 of them are homemade by me, the rest skilfully poured by Baristas from all around the world. I don't seem to tire of admiring their aesthetics and could easily spend hours in a museum gazing at coffee pictures - if there ever was such a museum.</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Culture to me means anything intellectually stimulating, be it traveling, learning new languages or educating myself about arts, music or cultures other than my own.</p>

<h3>...and Friends</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fitness: This doesn't start with a "C" but still impacts my daily life very much: all that is beneficial to physical and mental fitness in terms of workouts and mindfulness.</li>
<li>Last but not least: Audiobooks! I love listening to audiobooks, preferrably from <a href="https://audible.de">Audible</a>, while doing all those other things that have to be done but are veeeeery low down in my list of priorities such as household chores and gardening.</li>
